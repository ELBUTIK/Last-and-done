# Scenario
# Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

# The results have to be printed to the console.

# You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

# Test your code ‒ does it produce the results you expect?

# We won't show you any test data ‒ that would be too simple.


a = float(input("enter value of a:"))    # input a float value for variable a here
b = float(input("enter value of a:"))    # input a float value for variable b here

print(a+b)# output the result of addition here
print(a-b)# output the result of subtraction here
print(a*b)# output the result of multiplication here
print(a/b)# output the result of division here

print("\nThat's all, folks!")


print(1+2)
print(2-1)
print(2*1)
print(2/1)
print(2//1)
print(1**2)

name = "Lasha"
surname = "Butikashvili"

fullname = name + " " + surname

print(fullname)

age = input('type your age please: ')

print('your age is ' + str(age) + ' ' + name)
